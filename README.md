## Running the application
1) Install necessary libraries and dependencies (transformers, sklearn, torch, numpy, ...)
2) Run create_embeddings.py to pre-compute the context embeddings for the training and testing data set (those are saved locally in two .pt files)
3) Run classifier_training.py to train, test and evaluate the classification model
